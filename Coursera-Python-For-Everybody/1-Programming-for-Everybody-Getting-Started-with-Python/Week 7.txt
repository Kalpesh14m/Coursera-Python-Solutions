4.What does the following Python program print out?
tot = 0 
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
    tot = tot + 1
print(tot)
==> 5

6.What is a good description of the following bit of Python code?

for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :

print('After', zork)
==> Sum all the elements of a list

7.What will the following code print out?
smallest_so_far = -1
for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   if the_num < smallest_so_far :
      smallest_so_far = the_num
print(smallest_so_far)
==> -1
8.What is a good statement to describe the is operator as used in the following if statement:
if smallest is None :
     smallest = value
==> matches both type and value

9.Which reserved word indicates the start of an "indefinite" loop in Python?
==> while

10.How many times will the body of the following loop be executed?
